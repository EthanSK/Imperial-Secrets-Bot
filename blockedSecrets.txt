If you‚Äôre from the annexe I hope you get arse raped by a giraffe

To the dude always reacting to comments you're not tagged in. Stop trying to scrape in.

It's actually surprising how much you miss education after you've left. My main focus was always on the academics which meant i sometimes neglected socialising or participating in clubs. I've now graduated with a good degree from a top uni, have a high paying job in a position I'm happy with but it all feels a bit empty.

I never made the lifelong friends they say you will at uni and just assumed life will be better afterwards with money and success. Also, the fact that there was a much better chance of getting into a relationship at Imperial than there is now is quite depressing. But hey, at least I have a shit tonne of money and meaningless tinder dates

Keep partying kids, adult life isn't all that glamorous

I wish my friends would stop getting depressed about stupid shit that doesn‚Äôt matter, please stop.

Prostitution at De Wallen really helps fighting depression.

This page depressed me sometimes.. the number of casually racist/sexist/homophobic/etc posts is just incredible, and we're supposedly the educated part of society.

I‚Äôm slowly running out of reasons to not kill myself and I‚Äôm scared...

Anyone else suffer from anxiety and/or depression?

Just wanna know how many others are out there. Make a secret in response if you want.

Seems like the red-haired feminazi stopped visiting this page and the admins stopped being overly politically correct. But being a true scientist I have to test my theory:
SUICIDE, SUICIDE, SUICIDE

I have depression and I understand how you feel, especially because I‚Äôve felt so bad that I really couldn‚Äôt imagine it getting any worse. Psychotherapy really helps, so I suggest talking to your GP. They are used to dealing with this and can always prescribe you medication if they believe it would benefit you. Don‚Äôt wait till it gets better on its own, because the truth is - it won‚Äôt. You need to seek help from others!

Uni really isn‚Äôt what I thought it would be. I work so hard to barely  scrape average grades and I‚Äôm pretty lonely. All the friendships I have here seem almost fleeting and out of convenience, and to top it off I‚Äôm not even really friends with my housemates.
I‚Äôm part of a wide circle of friends, I play and go out a lot with my sports club, and I‚Äôm generally an outgoing person. You wouldn‚Äôt guess that I hated it here unless you asked me.
I know that Imperial is a good uni and has a great reputation but is it really worth it?
Is anyone else in the same situation/has any advice?

If the lab reports don‚Äôt make me kill myself, the chemicals in labs will kill me anyway.

This bi guy I like has an on/off boyfriend. Should I still ask him out? I want his cummies üò≠üòî

I've recently run into financial troubles, and have no idea how to solve it... I'm not rich, not too poor either, but can't just beg my parents for the extra money. The idea of having to change my lifestyle scares me (I've become too used to the way I live). I haven't been excessively spending or anything like that, just splashing on small bits and pieces - it was quite fun initially, but now accumulated and got more serious.
How can I earn money quickly? (it's not even that much - not more than ¬£1000)

try and speak to anyone in the library. You will receive a look like you've raped their sister. oh Imperial...

Even the coffee machines are starting to sound depressed when you wake them up...slow agonising groans as the meagre drips of lukewarm "coffee" are served begrudgingly.

In all seriousness though, can central library buy hammocks/beanbags or something so people can take emergency naps?

Any tips on managing stress/depression/anxiety? I start therapy in six weeks so I need some solutions till then. üôÇ

P.S. Please post this - I'm definitely not suicidal.

Really not very low. Unless you have worked as either a warden or sub warden you really are in no place to talk about how much work they do, especially in relation to often confidential pastoral duties.

Quite frankly put, without the work that wardening teams do on a daily basis the welfare of the student body would suffer massively, and it is very likely that the thankfully rare yet tragic cases of suicides amongst those living in halls would increase in frequency.

It may not be obvious to you but the wardens themselves provide invaluable support to sub-wardens, they provide experience, and advice that makes the stressful task of looking after a large group of people often living away from home for the first time manageable.

With respect to rent, the cost (in time and stress) pretty much cancels out any benefits.

Rant over.

Dear JP,
I just baked you a finger pie, why don't you cum and taste it?
Love, your secret slut

Anyone who has an abortion or supports the process directly should face harsh punishment, except in the case of rape, and I'm not perfectly sure about that either. These are my views. Discuss.
Please answer in a response secret and not in the comments so we can say what we really want to.

Yah I feel the exact same constantly, that absolutely no one likes me it really makes life depressing

Vanilla people using London slang gives me crippling depression

Things not to say to someone with depression #1
"you know the reason people don't share their stuff with you as much as you do with them is because YOU JUST HAVE MORE PROBLEMS"
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Srsly tho plz stop

Literally cannot agree with you more. Labour would thrive under the perfect/ideal circumstances, but they never encounter that the world is more realistic than ever. Get your leftie heads out of your arse and take a look at the bigger picture you wanker. I can‚Äôt wait for the NHS to get fucked over by conservative and start reforms, at least that‚Äôs better than Labour fucking up the whole country.
I know the conservatives are a bunch of selfish twats, but at least they‚Äôll make the country rich (even if it means some suffering for a few people, again, bigger picture).
‚ÄúOh yeah, Jeremy said free tuition, let‚Äôs vote for him, who cares if he ACTUALLY has the money, duhhhhh.‚Äù
Btw, I came from a working class family. And I for one, think that this country has too much pride in her to admit the fact the British empire days are over.

"I, Riccardo Pierre am sorry for throwing up in an Uber on the way back from the club, and having to let my friend Bastian Shi (actually called Yuxin or some shit) pay an extra ¬£110 for the cleaning costs, which is bullshit because it does not take ¬£110 to scrape a bit of vomit out of the back seats of a Toyota Prius. I will never down 14 shots in the club again."

Is it worth the effort grafting? why not just scrape by

Cycling through different levels of depression because its her birthday

Mental health is a myth. If you're feeling depressed or stressed out by your course maybe you're just not good enough to be here lol.

I like to constantly talk about girls so under no circumstances whatsoever there is contention over my sexuality. I AM 100% STRAIGHT OK?

An objective look at Imperial and how to improve it (please go to TL:DR a sudo- lab report on what I think of Imperial)-
Sorry First time posting noob.  A hateful person view at how to improve Imperial-
A biased argument
To better improve one‚Äôs environment, one must first improve the social circumstances of that environment.  I think Imperial is no longer a place that reasonable argument can be had.  I think that in part that comes about on an Imperial student‚Äôs instinctive nature to rely on social media to have debate and have an argument, this allows for desensitization to occur to someone who equally can happily rationalise your arguments as well as your own, but equally understands that change comes through action.  How can we immediately set about improving that situation for students?  (I see Imperial Secrets as more a vestige of the logical negative manifestations that are allowed to propagate at this university.  What we know as students is that healthy discussion needs to take place, but to do that students often need good intentions.

I argue that we as students are no longer able to emotionally, rationally discuss topics of welfare, social behaviour and the detrimental effects of 'group' behaviours on community spirit without ourselves feeling in some way victimised.  The reason why I see that is there are a lot of students simmering with discontent throughout university, (these are on a range of issues that will become apparent [Race, Religion, Gender, Economic Factors, Housing etc.]).  If you spend more than about 20 minutes scrolling through Imperial Secrets you can see this.  There are also some amongst us who may or may not hold more authoritarian views- my opinion on these views are that they are a result of frustrations at injustice that go not unpunished but unchanged, we need a healthy medium for debate.  The issue with Imperial comes with how it is run too, we at our heart are an international university, and I certainly feel that particularly because we are a university with a substantial amount of interests both commercially and internationally (it is in our interest that Imperial relies heavily on International students [as well as their fees]).  Please infer nothing racial from that.  We perhaps, are required, for this place to operate in a way that enables actual positive learning for its students to give students more of a platform for views, but perhaps mediate more.  My heart says this is true, as we are past the point of mediation, my head says if I put my head down and ignore the root cause of the problems I can succeed, but that second part is an atypical male response.  That perhaps stems from the fact that microcosms of culture can exist very easily at Imperial.  I for one don't think that any one students society, gender, person, culture is to blame for its inherent problems, nor any lecturers (they're people too).

I believe this stems almost from a lack of proper discourse, and a genuine lack of ability to create a network of students to actually be able to action an real change.  Look how long it took to get AC in the Library, look at what used to exist in Albertopolis originally in place of the central libray (google it), look what used to exist in place of the CGCU and the RCSU as well.  It was a Victorians idea of what a British university should be.  Did it get dismantled? Are we seeing parallels today with a new campus?

I would also go further by saying this, I believe our British universities attract all the fringes of society and they must to exist, but in order to do that they have to adequately foster discussion, but in order to do that they need to act in a unified form to tackle student and lecturer.  Chicken and Egg.

Unfortunately, I think economic status must also be considered.  I'm sad seeing friends on scholarships from other countries being unable to continue.  I‚Äôm sad that fees have increased, I‚Äôm sad that living costs for students are being further squeezed.  Perhaps the reason that Imperial cannot care about students, as well anymore is due to the fact we as students never really have had enough help to gain a voice.  Perhaps Imperial needs just to downsize overall student size, become a normal university, introduce the classics, such as Philosophy, History, and perhaps emulate Oxbridge more?  Perhaps in London that is impossible?  Would it help humanise the university?  Ask ourselves why it might be necessary to do so and ask are some issues at Imperial now becoming a societal problem as opposed to a problem of more 'culture and group mentality'.

The only way I can see Imperial improving is through mediated recorded debate like panopto with questions and distinct dates.  It sadly must be mediated because I feel like people would vent frustrations in the worst way, like IC secrets.  This would give students and lecturers all the ability to watch and ask the very hardest questions that face our university- (that or perhaps we follow in the example of how lecturers behave by striking- (we procrastinate enough).  As I know that often strikes can be an option for people, whether you believe that to be right or not is up to you.  What can we change to overcome that people feel the need to strike?  I think we at Imperial are a manifestation of our own agreeableness- either have a debate, or at the very least get involved in a society.  Don‚Äôt let your own future ambitions degrade a society, and understand that people at Imperial are generally either unkind or apathetic whether through nature or nurture.  With that knowledge promote change?  Don't be apathetic?

That girl who's always there to help people's suicidal and depression posts... you are stunning. Please be mine, please. love you too much <3 <3


stop the "editors notes" please removes the integrity of this page thanks

Admin's Note: how does it remove integrity if it's just tacked on and not actually part of the secret? that's the whole point of an "editor's note" - it's not part of the secret





my neighbour got a ukulele and now he thinks he's Jimi Hendrix just cause he's brown... he only knows one chordüò°

uni is a trap. i was way too young and immature when i started at imperial 3 years ago and i just didnt have the life experience to see it through. i simply did not have the life experience to become a successful university student. 
the biggest regret of my life is not taking a gap year. i thoroughly encourage any person wanting to go to uni at 18 to take a gap year. you need to learn what life is truly about!

imperial underground society is the best üéâüéâ Feel free to find Jer Jer for more detail

I haven't changed my sheets since before Christmas and have shagged a bunch of guys (& girls) since. Is this normal?

Have a vague memory of submitting a few secrets drunk, no idea what they were, now waiting for them to be posted with mounting anxiety

Why does no one here have a good beard? üò≠

I don't get why DoCSoc allows people to simply buy the membership. It's clear that all the scum from other departments buy it because they want free drinks at our bar nights. At the very least the candidates should be required to complete a coding challenge. I don't want to drink free alcohol with people who cannot even code merge sort in python, which btw is like the easiest thing ever.

Has anyone taken antidepressants before? Do they help ? 

I like this page because it makes me realise I‚Äôm not the only one who thinks nearly everyone in this uni is a scumbag and all my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù here are twofaced cunts ;) can‚Äôt wait to leave

Disappoints me when someone who is genuinely in mental discomfort or having a hard time posts a secret about anxiety or depression and some people think it's funny to tag their friends in the comments as if it's a big joke.

There is using humour as a coping mechanism or relating to a post, and then there is open ridicule of someone. These people who need help are reading the comments on their post and seeing everyone take the piss?

Are we that detached from reality that we don't care about each other anymore?

How to get a girlfriend 101: contrary to popular belief, do not under any circumstance 'be yourself', especially if you're at imperial. DO smoke because that's cool. If all else fails make sure they are made aware of the concealed blade you are carrying. Good luck lads and lesbians&co.

Something about me being lonely and the imperial ratio. Pls give me pity likes.

RD is sooooo skinny and has an amazing body. Teach me your ways pls

Not trying to trivialise women‚Äôs issues or anything but are there actually any women out there that care about men‚Äôs issues? Cause most of the ones I‚Äôve talked to about this deny men even have any issues  :(

I love Smash Bros as much as the next guy, but if the new game being made for the Nintendo Switch doesn‚Äôt include EVERY SINGLE ONE of these characters, then it is 100% going to be trash.

"When I become your next union president I‚Äôll expel people like you from the walls of this prestigious university" in the replies was even more cancerous than the blatant bait post. Get a life you furry cuckold fuckhead.

Idea: run a Facebook page parallel to Imperial Secrets where RD offers therapeutic advice, surreal memes, and chit-chat to the anons.

Anyone else feel like this? When you've been feeling lonely/ depressed/ unmotivated, and you finally feel like you want to be happy and productive, but being depressed is now your comfort zone. Or maybe you feel scared to be happy. Or that you think you don't deserve it. Or that people will judge you from going to a quiet person to a happier more talkative person. It's strange. Feel like a kid sulking, stubborn, not wanting to forget and move on. 

chris ford stole my shrimps how do i apply for mitigating circumstances

Guys don‚Äôt ever be afraid to talk about your feelings. Fuck the ignorant idea that opening up about your emotions isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù (if anything it‚Äôs the most masculine thing you can do). This is especially important these days and especially in the UK, considering that male suicide rates, particularly, are much higher than female (disparity worse in the UK I believe) because men often bottle everything up and in the end they feel nothing can help them and they take their own lives, so PLEASE don‚Äôt let it get to this stage. 

Open up to your guy friends too, it‚Äôll help them talk about their issues as well if they have any. Keep checking up on all your friends now and then to make sure they‚Äôre doing okay too. I‚Äôve known someone who took his life 2 years ago, and no one even knew what he had been going through. 

Let‚Äôs end this stigma and start talking.

Imperial Secrets... has changed. It's no longer about crushes, depression, or petty complaints. It's an endless series of memes written by shitposters and oxbridge rejects. Imperial Secrets, and its consumption of productivity, has become a well-oiled machine. Imperial Secrets has changed. Dead students post dead secrets, using dead copypasta. Curly fries inside their bodies enhance and regulate their abilities. Course rankings, lecturer rankings, hall rankings... 
meme rankings. Everything is ranked and kept under control. Imperial Secrets has changed. The age of Balaji has become the age of Dowling. All in the name of distracting our attention from the upcoming exams. And he who controls the memes, controls history. Imperial Secrets has changed... When the memes are under total control, shitposting becomes routine.

Anyone listen to Flatbush Zombies, Suicide Boys or The Underachievers? fucking wavey shit

The sole useful output of Algebra revision so far:

God Tier
Klein Group (Only 4 elements, great source of counter-examples)

Great Tier
Dihedral Groups (Two equations govern whole group, nice to work with)

Normie Tier
Cyclic Groups (Pretty boring but easy to use)

Bad Tier
Symmetric Groups (nightmare to work with)

Shit Tier
Alternating Group (Basically just a shit symmetric group)

Kys Tier
Groups of upper triangular matrices (When Liebeck really wants to fuck you over and the simplest counter example is of order 27)

The most depressing moment when you really like your coursemate but too afraid to tell anyone else because you don‚Äôt want to ruin the friendship :( 

Over a few years I have been dealing with ‚Äòmild‚Äô anxiety. I like to say I was ‚Äòborderline‚Äô depressed. It started in year 13. 

Funny how as time goes by and I get better - actually better, from within, as opposed to temporary relief from any treatment, I realise more and more how bad I was before. I honestly had no idea that the way I was feeling was not ‚Äòslightly under the weather most of the time‚Äô - it was so much worse.

To me depression has been like a weird kind of cage - one that you cannot see from the inside, unless you are holding the key that opens it. Kind of a high-brow metaphor, but this describes it the best for me. Unless you are ready to leave, you don‚Äôt even realise that you are not ‚Äòin a bad mood‚Äô or ‚Äòunder the weather‚Äô - you are in a cage. And only after you leave and look back can you see just how many bars you were seeing the world through.

To anyone going through this: believe in yourself, whatever the cage of yours is - you can get out. Therapy is necessary, it facilitates your ‚Äòescape‚Äô, but the real change comes from within. Never give up.

I'm confused about whole gender fluid/non-binary thing... Sex is biological, which is (except in very very exceptionally rare circumstances) binary. Gender is something that we as a society have made up to fit in with certain stereotypes of what it means to be a boy/girl. 
Why do gender fluid/non-binary people want a different pronoun? The pronoun he/she has nothing to do with which gender someone identifies with, it is to do with their sex, which is binary.
In fact why do people find it necessary to talk about which gender they identify with; gender is completely made up and means absolutely nothing, and makes no difference to how you go about your life. Are gender fluid/non-binary people just seeking attention?
Honestly can't see any other reason, would appreciate any alternative points of view...

Let's increase the number of posts by sending in our own stories so that we can encourage other people to write too. I myself feel a bit discouraged from posting on Scientists of Imperial because it seems like nobody posts there and I feel like nobody would hear me. Plus it seems like the page is for one complete story instead of small snippets of how my mental health is. Tbh I still feel more comfortable posting to Imperial Secrets even though 90% of my mental health related secrets have not been posted (nothing suicidal, just overall depressing). It would be nice if Scientists of Imperial could be a place to be heard and supported when things are just getting worse.

Why does everyone always want to be happy and strive for this idea of constant, never ending happiness? Its unacheivable so are you just lying to yourself, convincing yourself that day of endless bliss is just around the corner maybe once uni is done or once you've got that 'perfect' job? 
Should I be mindlessly lying to myself too?
Honestly I dont know whats wrong with just wallowing in the sadness of life. Whats wrong with being down, depressed or deeply unhappy....why fundamentally is that a worse state to live life in? Everyone always says happiness is key....to what though? 

I'm sick of all these tier rankings, so I'm making Top 10 lists instead

Top 10 Fruits :
1. Avocados
2. Bananas
3. Oranges
4. Grapes
5. Apples
6. Blueberries
7. Mangos
8. Strawberries
9. Pears
10. Pineapples

Courses with the littest people in order:




1. Medicine (I would be depressed af if I was doing anything else at Imperial)






2. Everyone else

Not even from imperial but the comment sections seem to actually give good advise or counselling. What‚Äôs with guys‚Äô mentality to hide their girlfriends? I just want to be shown off man :/ am I that much of an embarrassment that most of your friends don‚Äôt even know I exist :/ If so why get with me in the first place? Exams are stressful enough I don‚Äôt need you to make me even more depressed man :/

I thought lack of sex was the major source of my depression and unhappiness, but I was wrong. As a man, I‚Äôve been successful in hookups with girls, yet I‚Äôm still depressed.

I need love! True love! From a girl I love! I want a stable loving relationship now and no more of these one-nighters. I want to settle down.

I feel like a lot of my problems would be resolved if I just lived in the moment. Past regrets, future worries and anxieties, I just can‚Äôt stop overthinking and just end up making myself feel shit all the time. Feeling depressed about my past and anxious about the future... how do I just live in the present? My mind wanders too much :(

Why don‚Äôt you fucking post my secrets regarding my mental health?? I get that you don‚Äôt want too many ‚Äúdepressing‚Äù secrets on here but I just want some advice, I know I should seek help but I want to see if people here can offer advice too so why do you not post it? :(

I've never admitted to anyone I feel down sometimes. Like my course is crushing. But if I were to ever need support/pastoral care, where should I go? I don't want to go to a doctor because I KNOW I'm not depressed and I don't want someone to convince me that I am. idk I'll probs never really need it as I can normally get to a stage where I can break down all my issues and get through them step by step, but you know it would be good to know what I'd do if I ever needed support. I don't really feel like I would want to talk to friends about it, I don't want weight on their shoulders if you get what I mean?

So, I'd like a sweat equity position in a company where an "idea guy" reminiscent of Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, etc. can manage me. Ideally, there would be no pay, but just the promise of a future small portion of ownership of the company I created. Does anyone know any "brains of the operation" guys looking for some mindless code monkey nerds to direct? Also, it'd be great if they had no experience of any kind in the industry and did no research of any kind into competition (I mean, not even a google search). It is mandatory that their description of their company be in the format "like [other company], BUT". So, "like facebook, but...". I would prefer them to have no business or coding skills of any kind, so they'll be free to express their unbridled, uncorrupted creativity. I would also like massive underestimates of the worked required to implement their idea and no concept whatsoever of the time it take to fulfill their ambitions. I would like for their creativity to be unencumbered by concepts like "reality" and whatnot. They should rely completely on me for the unimportant things such as creation of the app, so they can focus on the real work, like telling me what to do.
Are there any positions available like that? Please drop by and pitch me your app at an opportune time, such as a family gathering or social occasion of any kind! Thanks!

After careful consideration I have concluded that Asian cum is the best tasting thing in the world. Fight me

The one that jokes the most is always the one that's depressed

If you want your presidential candidate to be depressed and a virgin you could always call in Imperial Analytica. 

If I fail my degree I blame the couple living in the single room at the end of the corridor on LG who have kept me up two nights in a row until 03:00-04;00. I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing in there but it sounds like one of two things: 
i) The guy is beating his girlfriend who screams and cries all night long.
ii) It‚Äôs some weird kink and he‚Äôs just yelling something dirty at her but it‚Äôs in Chinese so it just sounds like he‚Äôs angry and meanwhile she screams for more crying something which phonetically sounds like ‚ÄúTing Che! Ni zai shao hai wahhh!‚Äù which I imagine loosely translates to ‚Äúharder daddy‚Äù or something.

The problem with (ii) is that it lasts a good 60-90min and having seen the guy, I think he‚Äôd struggle to go 5min let alone an hour screaming and shouting.
What ever is going on wether it‚Äôs a torture chamber or a sex dongeon (would make sense on LG i suppose) it‚Äôs keeping me up at night. 

Side note: Does anyone think this could qualify as mitigating circumstances? I end up so tired I sleep past my alarm and don‚Äôt wake up until 13:00-14:00 meaning I‚Äôm losing valuable revision time in the mornings! 

How do u KNOW going into a relationship when you‚Äôre not ‚Äúmentally ready‚Äù will always be bad and toxic?? How do you know that someone‚Äôs unconditional love can‚Äôt make you feel better and less shit about yourself and life? It might not necessarily make you codependent. Maybe they could just provide you with the confidence and love you need and you could both empower each other, and you COULD end up from being in a bad place to being in a much better place mentally thanks to them and it might not necessarily be toxic/codependent?! I‚Äôve known people who have gotten into relationships, people who were essentially suicidal but even after their relationship ended they were left in a much better place because the person they were with uplifted them so much. Yes I‚Äôm aware this isn‚Äôt the case with every situation and I know it‚Äôs more likely it‚Äôll be fucked up but there is no guarantee it will be shit so telling people otherwise doesn‚Äôt make sense üòíüòí even I‚Äôve had a bf who made me feel
important for once in my life and yeah I went back to feeling fucking shit once we broke up but at least TEMPORARILY I felt I was worth something. This probs won‚Äôt make sense to most people but I just don‚Äôt like the idea being suggested that people struggling mentally aren‚Äôt worthy of relationships or won‚Äôt do well in relationships because you never know the outcome.

Sorry for the long post and if I offended anyone. 

Bit of a weird one but for a while now, I‚Äôve not been feeling myself and a lot of things have been getting to me and I‚Äôve been a bit all over the place, and my mood was really low - there are quite a few things that initially contributed to it but my reaction to these things have been much worse than before, mentally . I looked up the advice available online when I considered seeing my GP about it but it mentioned that for things to be seen as mental health issues they usually have to have been around for around 6 months. So I left it. Around 6 months on, and I‚Äôm feeling perhaps worse, particularly when I‚Äôm alone at night, more and more the case when I‚Äôm revising for exams etc. I really do want to see my GP about this but I‚Äôm worried that it might come across as a medical student wanting extenuating circumstances (NOT the case at all, I definitely want to sit my exams ‚Äúnormally‚Äù) or just getting stressed about exams etc when it really is a bigger issue than that in terms of duration. Shall I just wait until after exams so I‚Äôm seen more seriously? 

Whoever wrote #ImperialSecret_7273 never suggested that balanced and fair criticism of Israel was Anti-Semitic. However they had pointed out that Corbyn has allied himself with 'militant anti-Israel movements,' presumably Hamas and Hezbollah. It's easy to see how a group such as Hamas  have integrated Anti-Semitism into their ideology as their charter accuses Jews of being part of a global conspiracy whereby they use their money, influence and power to control the world. The Hamas Charter even references the antisemitic fabricated text,  'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion' as if it were a legitimate document.  {Hamas Charter Articles No. 22, 28, 32}

To clarify, people are not accusing Labour of being weak when it comes to combating Anti-Semitism because of Corbyn's criticism of Israel (no state is perfect and therefore all are open to criticism) but instead point out that even if he does not harbor any Anti-Semitic sentiments,  he seems rather comfortable to surround himself with those who do. When reading #ImperialSecret_7273 it is clear that this is the message that the author was trying to convey. 

I hate uni , seriously what a depressing waste of time and money 

In these dark days of revision it feels like everyone needs some support, so let me introduce you to the TRUE and only religion that can save you: the CHURCH OF üÖ±Ô∏èORDOMüíí. Legend has it a true GOD lives among us, the biggest man that ever stepped on Earth CHRIS üÖ±Ô∏èOrd has come down from his n-1 dimensional hyperplane in R^n üååto redeem us all from our sins (who hasn‚Äôt forgotten the +¬© when integrating) and guide us in this journey we call life. 
M1M1:3:12, series:
And so CHRIS üÖ±Ô∏èOrd  went into the lecture theatre and all the sophist turned their heads and stared at the living GOD. When HE got to the back of üÜëore, he drank from his GLORIOUS bottle of water üí¶and when he was about to start pronouncing the biggest of truths, the little mortalsüõêüõê in the room started shouting and insulting the TRUE GOD. So the MAN HIMSELF calmly said:‚Äùwell, that‚Äôs enough‚Äù and opened his mouth, shooting the mightiest of power series‚Ñ¢ giving a slow and painful death to the disrespectul students, who melted in a mass of misery and cumüòµüëÖüí¶üí•‚ö∞Ô∏è. And so the will of CHRIS üÖ±Ô∏èOrd was made as it always is. 
AmenüÖ±Ô∏è

The Pembridge warden tried to rape me 

Does anyone actually like to hang out with me? I'm starting to get depressed now that this long holiday is here. I feel like the friends I made were friends only because we see each other every week.

Serious question I want to know who actually enjoys uni? I see all my school friends having so much fun and when I meet up with them over holidays they all say they're having fun, one even said everyone is enjoying university apart from you.  I just find it really depressing here and really lonely 

Real club rankings:

[CUM ALL OVER YOURSELF AS SOON AS YOU WALK IN TIER]

Slug

[CAN HAVE A DECENT NIGHT BUT A BIT GENERIC TIER]

Most London clubs

[IF HIV WAS A CLUB]

Metric

Types of Mathematicians at Imperial:

1. Never to be seen anywhere (majority of this department) - can never find them in lectures or problem classes, or even in the general outdoors. Prefers to not leave their house unless absolutely necessary, e.g. for tests.

2. The annoying sesh heads - loud af, rude af, think they‚Äôre roadmen but actually care way too much about academics and their only other passion in life is getting w a v e d. People secretly dislike them but no one says it to their face. Probably want to go into Finance/Statistics.

3. The Europeans - good at literally fucking everything. Don‚Äôt really like going out on the sesh but will have a cheeky glass of wine now and then. Œµ-Œ¥ is what they live for, and it‚Äôd be a waste if they went into anything other than pure Maths research. Live to be on the Dean‚Äôs list.

4. Asians - prefer to stick in clusters and would rather not socialise with other people. Can be seen during all 9 ams wearing their ‚Äúantisocial social club‚Äù clothes.

5. The hopeless - have given up entirely on their degree, and give no fucks. Haven‚Äôt been to lectures this entire term, and are most likely clinically depressed by now. Still laugh at +C jokes, but Richard Thomas would be disappointed in them. Most are confused how they‚Äôve even made it this far into their degree.

6. Sports night fanatics - a mixed breed of Mathematicians, all with one thing in common; they. love. Sports night. You can usually find them trashed in Metric every Wednesday, and a lot of them are close to (5) but most still manage to make it to lectures.

7. The overly dedicated - make it to every. single. fucking. lecture, and problems class, even if it‚Äôs a full 9-6 day. Can be seen after literally every lecture questioning the lecturer about the material. Never go out anymore. They are now most likely dead inside.

8. Investment bankers - only doing this course for one reason. Don‚Äôt really give much of a fuck about the course, and are most likely on a Third, but are probably involved in a lot of societies and career events relating to IB. Harvey Specter is for some reason their role model.

There is truly no worse, more depressing, hurting feeling in the world than not being liked back by someone you love

Anyone else ever gone through a deep depression phase? 

Imperial Secrets application- Daniel Burridge.  Since I normally just chat shit in all my secrets I thought it would be time to share my wisdom and give some decent tips on how you can be a BNOC like myself.
Tip 1: Confidence- Last year I was dumped by my ex; unphased I announced to the bois that she would be begging for me back before Christmas- she never did but that‚Äôs besides the point cus Federica liked my latest insta so who‚Äôs the real winner here? 
Tip 2: Join Boxing- went to BUCS, won one match by default cus the opponent was ill, boxed one match and lost by KO‚Ä¶ still came out of it with a free bronze and a norty insta though and as long as I tense up all the lads will still think I‚Äôm big.
Tip 3: Chirpsing- Since all the galdem here are under 50, I have to go to the weekly circuit session at Ethos to get my fix of mid-menopause milfs. All the bois laughed when I said Julie Varlie had potential but they‚Äôre probs just jealous cus she might be re-marking my fluids lab report that I got a fail in. Wish that perky mechanics tutor would hmu though. 
Tip 4: Disguise- Arrived at uni in Under Armour trackies, nearly convinced people I was actually road and not from Chalfont St Peters. Tbf though I went to a state school so don‚Äôt come down my ends chatting shit, Challoner‚Äôs is proper rough ennit. 
Tip 5: Free Locker ‚Äì Fill your locker with all your sweaty garms so that no-one would touch it with a stick. Apparently, man takes a diversion to get to BOSS now cus the smell is dirtttt, no need for a padlock. It‚Äôs about lateral thinking people. 
Tip 6: Exams- It‚Äôs all about faking disabilities to get minimum: 75% extra time, a hot drink , and a back massage off Fred. If you aint hustlin mitigating circumstances you aint in the game. Remember: If it starts with dys- you‚Äôve probably got it as long as you deliberately spell your name wrong on the test. Pro tip: Use Daddy‚Äôs money to buy a phat pack of prescription Ritalin off the nearest ADHD kid you can find; It‚Äôs not cheating if you don‚Äôt get caught.
Tip 7: Illusion- Pretend to yourself that you‚Äôre the biggest heavyweight drinker in uni, fill up a bottle of Smirnoff with 95% Carabou and walk round with it at the pre‚Äôs. When the 2 units hits you you‚Äôre gonna feel wobbly so make sure you pass the bottle on before you‚Äôre finished. Repeatedly tell everyone else they‚Äôre lightweights to hide your insecurities and make yourself look ‚Äòard. 
Well there we go, that‚Äôs more tips than I can fit in my bumhole‚Ä¶ and I went to Challoner‚Äôs. 
PS: Rob Waterhouse you seem pretty cool but just to clarify, we‚Äôre best mates right? 


To those AGAINST the removal of 7747:
Some of you are thinking ‚Äòthese libtard special snowflakes are just finding a reason to get offend, about anything slightly not PC‚Äô. I agree there are definitely certain times when not being PC can be funny. Hell I love Cards Against Humanity as much as the next guy, and when I play you can be damn sure I‚Äôll play the most messed up card I can find. I may disagree with the content posted but I will still defend your right to say it. That being said, I just want you to try and empathise a little with people that take offence to your joke.

I come from a culture that is pretty homophobic and for the longest time I didn‚Äôt see anything wrong about joking about gay people. Growing up, sure I figured some people might not like it, but I didn‚Äôt get what the fuss was all about. I didn‚Äôt think about it very much either until a friend explained how it felt. 

He explained how he was secretly gay and became depressed because of all the pervasive homophobic culture. Casual jokes about the LGBT+ community made him feel ridiculed and shamed even when they weren‚Äôt directed to him.

The thing is, its really hard to empathise with people over experiences that we can‚Äôt relate to and really easy to dismiss them taking offence as being over sensitive. Just remember what‚Äôs a casual joke to you isn‚Äôt necessarily the same for everyone else. 


To those FOR the removal of 7747:
I would like to start of by saying that I agree that 7747 was poor taste and dismissive of members of the LGBTQIA+. I also agree that such posts shouldn‚Äôt be brushed off as mere ‚Äòjokes‚Äô and that they perpetuate harmful ideas. All I ask is that you consider whether removal of the post really achieves what you want. 

There will always be some people that make jokes you find offensive. Let‚Äôs be clear, this doesn‚Äôt mean I think 7747 should have been posted. What I am saying is that removing views you disagree with doesn‚Äôt change the minds of the people you disagree with. All this achieves is making those people group up and perpetuate their views within their in-group. 

While in the short run censoring negative comments might make us better off, in the long run any censorship will only serve to fragment our community and only open dialogue and discussion will help others understand. Now some of you are rightfully thinking that a secrets page is anonymous and thus doesn‚Äôt constitute an open dialogue. I agree that this format is not ideal for discussion but at least you have the opportunity to express why you disagree and hopefully change their mind.

Anyone want to cum fly with me? ;)

IMPERIAL SPORTS TEAMS RANKED AS ITEMS FROM THE MCDONALDS MENU 
Hockey - On the surface, you might think (as they themselves do) that they are the ‚ÄòBig Macs on Campus.‚Äô Could not be more wrong. Bite into the surface and you‚Äôll find they‚Äôre a bit odd and not that impressive. Skills include: strawpedos, bragging about strawpedos. For being all bark and no bite: Spicy Vegetable Deluxe. 

ICSM Hockey - Same as above but not as good at Hockey, trying even harder to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and with more red: Vegetable Deluxe, with extra ketchup. 

Football - Lack of actual footballing ability in this niche student population has propelled your run-of-the-mill Joe Allen to meteoric heights. As a result, footballers at Imperial are not as cool, as good-looking or as good at football as you might have expected, despite being nice blokes. For failing to live up to the hype: Maltesers McFlurry 

Lacrosse ‚Äì You probably went into this thinking it was going to be a bit shit, and you know what, they probably are a bit shit. But when you get as drunk as often as they seem to, nothing hits the spot quite like this: 99p Chicken Mayo 

Boat -  Surprisingly talented, but they really struggle to connect with people. Talk of their expensive boats, erg times and un-ironic use of ‚Äòyah‚Äô and ‚Äòrah‚Äô in day to day speech will alienate us ‚Äòcommon‚Äô folk. For being just a tad too posh: any item from the Signature Collection

Netball - Undeniably good, insufferably basic: McCaf√© Frappuccino

Ultimate Frisbee: When you heard about them you were like ‚Äòwtf?‚Äô and despite it seeiming like a fun idea, you have to ask yourself if this even is a real thing: Veg Pizza McPuff (‚Äì India McD‚Äôs)

Rugby - ah Rugger. A blend of Boat‚Äôs poshness and Hockey‚Äôs‚Ä¶cuntness? Their medics are shit, not even worth a paragraph. You have to ask yourself: is the macho brand, the naked showers, the never-ending dick-measuring and substitution of personality with pints worth it? Fun, bold and not for the faint-hearted, this will either leave you feeling glorious or horribly insecure about your body: 20 Nugget Share Box (for one); Apple and Grape Fruit Bag (medics). 

Snowsports ‚Äì Although no club at Imperial truly deserves the top prize, Snowsports do deliver consistently one of the greatest weeks of your Imperial careers before retreating to hibernate till next winter: Big Mac(s) for a week.

American Football - Think they‚Äôre decent, but only really rated by themselves. Most of the time you look at this (menu) item and think that they just seem a bit out of place. The majority will keep their distance from this one: Any McSalad

Boxing ‚Äìcome across as taking themselves a bit too seriously. This group of wannabe-AJs train hard to be the very best but despite their admirable passion and pursuit for glory, when the dust settles on the Imperial Social scene they are just a tad irrelevant: Fillet O‚Äô Fish 

Athletics: Lean and mean, athletics is a vast club. There‚Äôs so many of them it‚Äôs hard to keep track (pun very much intended). A generally chill group, not controversial or interesting in any particular way, Athleticists are the neutrals of Sports Night. Hated by no-one but also not overtly loved, it‚Äôs safe to say they‚Äôre good with everyone and everything: Large fries. 


My formula for Garen support success:
> Take Dubstep fire and yellow blink for ss and EEE and EIE masteries
> Buy Dolan's blade and healthy drink
> Run into botlane and commit suicide to tower (doesn't matter if enemy is there, obviously)
> Say that "we're objectively winning because the tower lost 30 hp and got +1 gold"
> Go into jungle and killsteal jungle's blue or red using Q
> Spam Ctrl + 1 as you spin back into lane
> Steal all your adc's creeps (by 20 mins you should have >120 cs and he should have <30)
> Watch him complain and ragequit
> Don't worry about being reported: nobody wants to listen to sqeakers anyway and everyone else will probably mute him
> Extract his tears from the computer screen
> Consume them to forget about that 24% you got in the last test

Any thoughts about how to improve? I want to climb ladder. I'm currently in Bronze V in EUW, NA, and Japan and idk how to get better at this point. @Imperial_College_ESports_Varsity

I love how my male privilege entitles me to be 11 times more likely to die at a workplace than a woman

I love how my male privilege entitles me to be 9 times more likely to commit suicide than a woman 

I love how my male privilege gives me just a 15% chance of winning custody of my children

I love how my male privilege means im three times more likely to be homeless than a woman

Let‚Äôs be real everyone, women are discriminated a lot of time, but we need to be aware that men go through shit too and we need to strive to improve this discrimination Just as much as we do with female issues

Thoughts?

To the Lovely, Ad-Hominiem Free Writer of Secret 8199,

"Describing the action of the page to remove the content is in absolutely no way a restraint on anyone's freedom of speech. They are simply choosing not to broadcast that particular speech to their users."
Restraint: A measure or condition that keeps someone or something under control. [Oxford]
Not posting someones secret is a measure to keep that person and their speech under control. It controls their speech because actions were taken to control what they could say on this platform. Not saying if this is a good or bad thing or not, just that it is the case.

"The page reserves the right to do that for all of their content, and it's totally at their discretion what they consider inflammatory"
Yes I know I'm not saying the secret should'nt be removed. What a wild and unreasoned assertion! Im simply telling you that this reserved right contradicts freedom of speech as a principle NOT A LAW.

"in this case it was user backlash which was met with removal, which is totally fair."
This is a normative statement.

"A restraint on free speech would be if a platform had content removed by a third party"
Very true.

"No platform owes a particular individual the right to express themselves on it unless the individual owns the platform."
Again, this is a normative statement.

"Also you probably shouldn't use Oxford dictionary in an argument like this. It's not particularly comprehensive as you're trying to summarise pages of legislation surrounding this with an umbrella description of the general principle. However, just to clarify, no-one has broken the law, not the page nor your precious free speech martyr."
I did not make a legal argument. I made an argument relating to the general principle so it is correct to use the definition relating to the general principle. UK law does not guarantee the unrestricted right to freedom of speech. It explicitly says in the law that the right will not be upheld under certain circumstances, such as hate speech. I never said they had broken the law, nor did I say that their actions should have broken the law, nor did I say the secret shouldn't be removed. Your assuming my opinions on the topic just because of the argument I presented. Tut tut tut.

Hope this clears things up. ;)

P.S: Fuck the copycats

Some people are so stupid and unaware about mental health issues.

A few weeks ago, I told one of my friends about my depression and anxiety. She actually fucking began comparing it to her year 8/9 emo phase, and told me I "would be over it soon". Honestly how fucking ignorant can people get?!

I just overheard someone saying that ‚Äòdepression is a choice‚Äô which really triggered me for some reason as I can definitely say that this illness literally takes over my life just like cancer and any other serious illness. 
Please stop being such a cunt and do some reading.

With each passing day, and the more I realise I should have taken work this year seriously, now I‚Äôm left trying to just scrape a pass 

So can we talk about Davy Klugs course... Like the thing potters along being about as interesting as cardboard but not too hard and then bam,L8 wtaf was that. Like he was just pulling equations out of his rear  and mumbling the notes on the slides. The man sounds like a depressed Eeyore and by then end of all that I'm on that level too.

##### WARNING: SOCIO-POLITICAL SECRET #####

I was seriously abused by a gang of people of a certain race when I was younger. I only got to where I am today because I became a workaholic to escape what was happening to me. No one listened to me or helped me when I was a child. I tried to speak up amongst a group of "friends" at Imperial, but before I could get anywhere close to saying what happened to me, a "friend" of mine at Imperial, who is openly left wing exploded in a fit of rage at me. He yelled at me in front of everyone, telling me that I am very narrow minded; that my "parents" have done a lot for me (when in fact my family fell apart when I was an infant and I grew up in a council estate without a father); that these people (the abusers) are from disadvantaged single parent families and I don't know what it's like. I got to where I am through my hard work despite unbelievable circumstances. But the political left assumes that I am priviliged and privately educated. Why does the left hate me so much because I worked hard?

According to all known laws
of aviation,
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
- Barry?
- Adam?
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school,
three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!
- Bee-men.
- Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
...9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies.
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
Will we pick ourjob today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our top-secret formula
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
Honey!
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?



I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.

Studying for finals everyday make me feel so depressed & M1M1 papers are just inhumane. I want my life back

Do people actually do grapefruiting? Won't all that citric acid sting?

The parents are nothing but scummy chavs, inciting people to attack a hospital. If you've actually read the case, Alfie has something that has never been seen before in recorded history. Of course the doctors are going to be somewhat wrong when they have nothing to compare it to, that's how science works. But I don't see the chavs coming up with anything better, do you?

IMPERIAL SPORTS TEAMS RANKED AS ITEMS FROM THE MCDONALDS MENU 
Hockey - On the surface, you might think (as they themselves do) that they are the ‚ÄòBig Macs on Campus.‚Äô Could not be more wrong. Bite into the surface and you‚Äôll find they‚Äôre a bit odd and not that impressive. Skills include: strawpedos, bragging about strawpedos. For being all bark and no bite: Spicy Vegetable Deluxe. 

ICSM Hockey - Same as above but not as good at Hockey, trying even harder to be ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and with more red: Vegetable Deluxe, with extra ketchup. 

Football - Lack of actual footballing ability in this niche student population has propelled your run-of-the-mill Joe Allen to meteoric heights. As a result, footballers at Imperial are not as cool, as good-looking or as good at football as you might have expected, despite being nice blokes. For failing to live up to the hype: Maltesers McFlurry 

Lacrosse ‚Äì You probably went into this thinking it was going to be a bit shit, and you know what, they probably are a bit shit. But when you get as drunk as often as they seem to, this group of misfits probably wouldn‚Äôt trade places with anyone. For hitting the spot when inebriated: 99p Chicken Mayo 

Boat -  Surprisingly talented, but they really struggle to connect with people. Talk of their expensive boats, erg times and un-ironic use of ‚Äòyah‚Äô and ‚Äòrah‚Äô in day to day vernacular will alienate us ‚Äòcommon‚Äô folk. For being just a tad too posh: any item from the Signature Collection

Netball - Undeniably good, insufferably basic: McCaf√© Frappuccino

Ultimate Frisbee: When you heard about them you were like ‚Äòwtf?‚Äô and despite it seeiming like a fun idea, you have to ask yourself if this even is a real thing: Veg Pizza McPuff (‚Äì India McD‚Äôs)

Rugby - ah Rugger. A blend of Boat‚Äôs poshness and Hockey‚Äôs‚Ä¶cuntness? Their medics are shit, not even worth a paragraph. You have to ask yourself: is the macho brand, the naked showers, the never-ending dick-measuring and substitution of personality with pints worth it? Fun, bold and not for the faint-hearted, this will either leave you feeling glorious or horribly insecure about your body: 20 Nugget Share Box (for one); Apple and Grape Fruit Bag (medics). 

Snowsports ‚Äì Although no club at Imperial truly deserves the top prize, Snowsports do deliver consistently one of the greatest weeks of your Imperial careers before retreating to hibernate till next winter: Big Mac(s) for a week.

American Football - Think they‚Äôre decent, but only really rated by themselves. Most of the time you look at this (menu) item and think that they just seem a bit out of place. The majority will keep their distance from this one: Any McSalad

Boxing ‚Äìcome across as taking themselves a bit too seriously. This group of wannabe-AJs train hard to be the very best but despite their admirable passion and pursuit for glory, when the dust settles on the Imperial Social scene they are just a tad irrelevant: Fillet O‚Äô Fish 

Athletics: Lean and mean, athletics is a vast club. There‚Äôs so many of them it‚Äôs hard to keep track (pun very much intended). A generally chill group, not controversial or interesting in any particular way, Athleticists are the neutrals of Sports Night. Hated by no-one but also not overtly loved, it‚Äôs safe to say they‚Äôre good with everyone and everything: Large fries. 


I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety and depression for years and it‚Äôs a bummer. I think I‚Äôve gotten better this year, but when I see everyone else on my course revising for hours and doing well, it really demotivates me, especially when it‚Äôs my mates. 
I keep trying to compare myself to them but I shouldn‚Äôt because it‚Äôs just not the same. I‚Äôve got to deal with a lot of shit on top of revision. I guess I need to remember that, but I forget and continue to put the same amount of pressure on myself to do well. 
If I‚Äôve made some improvement from previous years, then I guess that‚Äôs good enough and I have to keep that in mind. Hope I don‚Äôt fail. 

It has become a depressing fact that I now measure money in terms of how many katsu curries it will buy me.
